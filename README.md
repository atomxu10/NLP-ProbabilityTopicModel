# Probability Topic Model: Model Comparison for Different Text Sizes ![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Python-green)

This project aimed to introduce, explain, and use probabilistic topic models, a class of statistical models for text data analysis designed to identify and extract latent topic structures from text data. This article focused on the **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model** in the probabilistic topic model, which is based on Bayesian statistical inference methods and uses the Dirichlet distribution to model the relationship between topics and documents. The main objective of the LDA model is to extract topics from textual data to enhance our comprehension of the content and to facilitate tasks like text classification.

The LDA model in the project was tested on three news dataset sizes: **title text, body text, and full content** to investigate the impact of text data size. The evaluation criteria for model quality were **classification efficiency and coherence score**.
